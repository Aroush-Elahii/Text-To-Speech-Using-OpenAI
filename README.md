# Text-To-Speech-Using-OpenAI
Simple yet powerful FastAPI-based application for converting text into speech using OpenAI's speech synthesis capabilities. Designed for developers looking to integrate text-to-speech functionality into their projects

Key Features:
FastAPI Framework: Built using FastAPI, this application provides a fast and efficient API for text-to-speech conversion, with easy-to-understand endpoints and robust error handling.
OpenAI Integration: Utilizes OpenAIâ€™s speech synthesis model to create lifelike voice outputs, allowing users to convert text into clear and natural-sounding speech.
Easy-to-Use API Endpoint: Includes a single endpoint /convert-to-speech/ where users can submit text via a POST request and receive an audio file in response.
Customizable Output: Allows for easy modification of parameters such as voice selection and model choice, making it flexible for different use cases.
Error Handling: Equipped with comprehensive error handling, including HTTP exceptions to ensure graceful handling of any issues during the speech synthesis process.

How It Works:
Input Text: Users send a POST request to the /convert-to-speech/ endpoint with the text they want to convert to speech.
Audio Generation: The application uses the OpenAI API to generate speech from the text input, utilizing the specified model and voice settings.
File Delivery: The generated speech is saved as an MP3 file and returned to the user as a downloadable response.

Setup and Usage:
Clone the repository.
Set up the environment variables, including the OPENAI_API_KEY.
Run the FastAPI application using uvicorn.
Send requests to the /convert-to-speech/ endpoint to convert text into speech.
This application is ideal for developers needing a quick and reliable solution for text-to-speech conversion, making it a valuable addition to any voice-enabled project.
